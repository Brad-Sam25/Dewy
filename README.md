<h1 align="center"> Dewy </h1>
Dewy is a skincare application that allows users to take a quiz to curate a specialized skincare routine that suits their needs

## Description

As a skincare enthusiast, I have taken a lot of skincare quizzes for different routine suggestions. In doing so, I noticed that they can be intimidating due to the big scientific/medical terms that are used to describe certain skin concerns. Respectively, I wanted to bridge that gap for those new to skincare, with a streamlined application. I present to youâ€¦ Dewy. My skincare application allows users to take a quiz that asks easy skin-related questions and creates a skincare routine that corresponds with their answers, minus the hard to pronounce terms.

However, it is important for me to note that not all skin concerns are as cookie cutter as some may think. As a result, I will be implementing more products, comment sections for users to discuss their concerns, favorite products, and suggestions so that we can all become skincare experts together!
